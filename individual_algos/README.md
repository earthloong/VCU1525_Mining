This folder contains generic standalone hash algorithms.
My hope is that other developers can use these as a learning tool, or as the basis to create improved / optimized algorithms for the FPGA community.

<b>Please note, most of these algos were written as part of multi-algo logic.  They will need to be tweaked a bit for your specific use.</b>

Below is a list of algorithms that I am going to try to provide and their status:

<ul>
<li>blake512</li>
<li>bmw512     (Not started)</li>
<li>groestl512</li>

Please note that I only work on this in my free time, so it may take some time for me to make updates.
